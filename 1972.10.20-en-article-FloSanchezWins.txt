Flo Sanchez wins on $ ticket
Florence Sanchez, one of Peter Solmon’s Dollar Ticket candidates, swept to an amazing ASUC primary win on a platform which urges a cutoff of funds for minority, social-action and other ‘partisan’ groups. Sanchez was aided by votes from pro-Solomon, New Direction Coalition, and minority voters. She was the only Chicana candidate who did not actively seek support from University minority programs. A transfer student from San Jacinto Junior College in Houston, Flo is majoring in Education. She began receiving financial aid from UMAS-EOP when she arrived in Boulder this fall. Flo said that she had no previous experience in either government or politics, and had decided to run for office when a friend told her that hardly anyone got involved in ASUC politics. She also said that the UMAS organization is very disorganized and that it should have input into student government when "the ideas of the UMAS student body will be helpful to the happiness of the general student body.”
Funds for UMAS organization should be allocated, Flo said, “according to need.” When asked what specific amount constituted UMAS organizational needs, Flo said that she didn’t know that the organization was funded by ASUC Senate appropriations. UMAS students who want to consult with Flo about ASUC matters can “come to my room in small groups," Flo said. Flo also said that UMAS students should vote for her because she would do her best to help them while on the ASUC senate.
