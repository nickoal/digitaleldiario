Election SpecialChicanos enter ASUC Senate RacesMinority programs at the University are under attack from all sides and at all levels: federal legislators are cutting funds indiscriminately, state officials quietly rearrange priorities so as to exclude minority programs front educational funds, and University administrators are determined to regularize (tokenize) our programs. The continual efforts by the Establishment to return to the days of majority dominance at minority expense are exemplified by the actions of student body president Peter Solomon. In the name of fairness he has continually opposed funding for what he calls partisan' campus groups. Solomon himself has engaged in partisan activities. including a gathering of student bodypresidents supporting President Nixon, yet he feels no need to rationalize his apparently contradictory behavior. Solomon knows that the masses just don't give a damn anymore. The general mood of apathy among students everywhere is the deadliest problem facing us.
