Lettuce boycott group meets with parents
The newly established Boulder Lettuce Boycott Committee met with parents of students at Lincoln Elementary School Wednesday night to explain the boycott and to ask for support. Richard Longoria, director of the United Farm Workers Denver Boycott office, was the guest speaker. He explained how newly proposed legislation in some states is directed at the UFW. In California, the proposed Proposition 22 would prevent the union from striking during critical periods, such as har-
vests, he said. In addition to Longoria's talk, the parents were shown a documentary film entitled “Migrant Workers.” The film dealt with the particular conditions affecting the migrant workers in the Florida citrus circuit. The Boulder Boycott Committee is a community organization which was started during the summer to further the boycott in this area. The group works in close cooperation with the United Farm Workers Union and the Farm Labor Task Force at the University.
